							<h3>Background:</h3>
							<p>Fable has always been more than just a reading app, it’s a place where stories come alive through community. But with the latest update, that magic felt lost. The new design made the clubs feel flat and distant, stripping away the warmth and sense of belonging that drew readers in. I wanted to bring that feeling back, to redesign the club experience into something immersive, personal, and human. My goal was to make readers feel like they’re stepping into the world of their book, surrounded by others who feel the same spark for storytelling.</p>
							<h3>The Problem:</h3>
							<p>Fable’s recent clubs update made the experience feel impersonal and flat. The clubs are meant to foster a sense of belonging, readers come together to discuss stories, share emotions, and build community,  but the new interface feels transactional rather than communal.<br><br>
                            As a user, I found that entering a club didn’t feel like stepping into a book world; instead, it felt like navigating a static list. The emotional connection that once existed between readers, books, and their shared space was lost. I want to feel like I’m walking into my book world, not scrolling through a file.
</p>
							<h3>Observations:</h3>
							<ol>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Club Layout: </strong><br>All clubs are presented as a simple list, ordered by recent activity. While this ordering logic makes sense, the design lacks personality.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Club identity:</strong><br>Each club is visually defined only by a small cover image, making different clubs feel interchangeable.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Interior experience:</strong><br>Once inside a club, the interface feels static. There’s little to differentiate each club’s atmosphere or theme.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chapters:</strong><br>The chapters appear as repetitive beige cards with hashtags and numbers, visually monotonous, with no sense of progress or excitement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chat rooms:</strong><br>Sections like Lobby, Book Recs, and Intros are conceptually strong but visually uninspired. They don’t feel like interactive spaces, more like folders.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mixed content types:</strong><br>The inclusion of TV shows may broaden the audience, but it risks diluting Fable’s original identity as a platform built for readers and book lovers.</li>
                            </ol>
